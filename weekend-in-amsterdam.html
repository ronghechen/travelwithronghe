       <p class="bodyText">After my last class that day, I took the Eurostar to Amsterdam. I finally arrived at 11:30ish pm, and checked into my Airbnb. However, I found out that my powerbank died (like DIED died), and there was no way to recharge it. My phone was on 12% battery, and I only had an "American" charger. I was freaking out at this point because I had my Eurostar tickets to London on my phone, not to mention my London to Cambridge train tickets. So if my phone actually died, there was no way for me to get back home. And so I slept, or at least attempted to. My Airbnb was in a very touristy area, with a lot of bars and pubs. Between the stress I was facing over my charger situation and people at pubs yelling about soccer at 3 am, it was hard for me to get any sleep.</p>
