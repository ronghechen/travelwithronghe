       <h3 class="subtitle">Here's an (overdue) post about what I did over spring break in Boston!</h3>
       <h3 class="bodyText">Institute of Contemporary Art</h3>
       <p class="bodyText">Since my hotel was in Seaport and the ICA was within walking distance and only $15 for students, I decided to give this one a visit. I just love contemporary art, since it's so abstract, groundbreaking, and has so much room for interpretation. Some exhibits that really
       stood out to me was the Shakers photo gallery, where Shakers are a religious community that emphasizes communal living, celibacy, shared property, gender and racial equality. Seeing their community in photos gives me a glimpse into a peaceful, nature-connected world so different from my own. Another exhibit that caught
       my eye was the Roman Empire exhibit, which showed photos of Rome (I've always wanted to go to Italy) and its historical architecture.</p>
