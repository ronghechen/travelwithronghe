       <h3 class="bodyText">TOURIST ATTRACTIONS</h3>
       <h3 class="bodyText">Fitzwilliam Museum</h3>
       <p class="bodyText">Located close to my accommodation, I really enjoyed viewing sculptures, paintings, and ancient artifacts in this museum! On the first floor was mostly sculptures from ancient Greece and Rome and pottery from Western Europe to the Middle East to East Asia, as well as armor from medieval Europe. The second floor was mostly paintings - historical paintings. A lot of these paintings focused on social commentary of their era, many of which had to do with the role of women in society. A painting that stood out to me was of a woman reading in nature, which represented how women (at the time) were expected to be connected to nature, and men were more associated with human culture, politics, and society. It seems very interesting because, although (unfortunately) gender stereotyping still occurs over certain occupations, the stereotypes have changed over the years. As I walked through the gallery, I saw paintings from many different perspectives. Many art museums focus on European paintings, since a lot of famous painters are from European countries. However, I had the opportunity to see paintings from around the world, and it felt great to see my culture represented in these museums.</p>

       <p class="bodyText">So yeah, that's my list of recs in Cambridge. If you ever end up visiting, be sure to check some of these things out!</p>
